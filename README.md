colemak for German text and Programming
=======================================

The Colemak keyboard layout for windows optimized for switching between typing german text and programming with the english symbols ([]{};/\). 

The original layout from colemak.com was tweaked by changing a few symbols and third level mapping only! Two layouts are created for quickly switching or just using one permanently.

For the german variant the Umlaute are directly accessable and the displaced parenthesis can be activated with Alt-Gr. The english layout was changed for easier indirect access to Umlaute, so AltGr+a=ä, AltGr+s=ß etc.
